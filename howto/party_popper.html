<H1>Python Powered Party Popper Puller</H1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    After reading about a number of wireless consumer devices having security issues
    I had the idea to create a workshop that introduced people to some of the concepts behind
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test" target="_blank">penetration testing</a>.
    It was only after reading about the failure of
    <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/totally-pwning-the-tapplock-smart-lock/" target="_blank">Tapplock</a>
    that I was finally spurred into action.
</p>
<p>
    Steering clear of using an actual product seemed like a sensible idea so I needed to create something I could authorize
    people to do attacks on. It wanted it to be something that would result in a reaction a little more dramatic than
    an LED flashing on.
    As exciting at that can be, I wanted something that could compete with those chemistry science communicators and
    their explosions.
</p>
<p>
    After experimenting with a couple of other ideas I came up with the idea of using a micro:bit to pull a
    party popper. Having it controlled over the radio module would allow for different attack vectors.
</p>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>Struggling to get started on what the machine should look like, I turned to Twitter for inspiration:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Help! Looking for some inspiration on how I
    can get a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/microbit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#microbit</a> to pull

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
    Suggestions came flooding in and Brian's caught my attention.

<h2>Using a Weight</h2>
<p>
    A bit of research had revealed that it took 20 newtons (or a 2kg stationary weight) to pull a party popper.
    Time for some experiments to see what that might look like as a machine...
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Project <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/remotepopper?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#remotepopper</a> has started <a href="https://t.co/COAoEQxKCS">pic.twitter.com/COAoEQxKCS</a></p>&mdash; Barry Byford (@uk_baz) <a href="https://twitter.com/uk_baz/status/1017816239509557248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>
    and test some different weights:

<p>
    While this had worked. It didn't feel like it was going to be reliable. As these were going to be used for a
    workshop they were going to have to be easy to build, store and transport. This solution didn't feel like it was
    going in the right direction so time to look at
    something else.
</p>
<h2>Using Servos</h2>
<p>
    One of the other solutions I'd had on Twitter was using servos. But what about the small problem of pulling 2kg?
    A fair bit of searching later and I found a database that listed lots of servos.
    But what did all that data mean?
    Clearly I was not the first person to think this as RCHelicopterFun.com had done a very good write-up explaining
    how to decide on the right servo for your project.
</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
    With a servo selected the next challenge was how to hold the party poppers and servos etc. A friend said I could use
    their 3D printer if I provided the filament. So time to get designing...
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trying to learn TinkerCAD for project <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/remotepopper?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#remotepopper</a> <a href="https://t.co/1gnpA7ZnK4">pic.twitter.com/1gnpA7ZnK4</a></p>&mdash; Barry Byford (@uk_baz) <a href="https://twitter.com/uk_baz/status/1019352495158591488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
    The 3D printer had a live feed so I could see how things were progressing:
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Status right now... Watching this via the live feed... <a href="https://t.co/6Y6aGfdxcc">pic.twitter.com/6Y6aGfdxcc</a></p>&mdash; Barry Byford (@uk_baz) <a href="https://twitter.com/uk_baz/status/1019539031577722882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The result looked better than I could have hoped for:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pretty happy with the way the print of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/remotepopper?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#remotepopper</a> came out. However it is turning out a lot harder to pull a party popper than you might think. We are going to need bigger batteries! <a href="https://t.co/b1V2VfHG7o">pic.twitter.com/b1V2VfHG7o</a></p>&mdash; Barry Byford (@uk_baz) <a href="https://twitter.com/uk_baz/status/1019686906991345664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
    There were however a few problems when trying to use the machine. Attaching the string from the party popper
    to the servo arm was fiddly. If I didn't have enough slack in the string the servo would stall and be damaged.
</p>
<p>
    If only I could find a better way of grabbing the string... Back to the drawing board...
</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
    The idea was that the string would get caught in the gears and get pulled. However it turns out printing gear
    wheels is trickier than I thought. I still like the idea but it was difficult to execute.
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All the gear, no idea! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RemotePopper?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RemotePopper</a> <a href="https://t.co/g17DnQ0UFO">pic.twitter.com/g17DnQ0UFO</a></p>&mdash; Barry Byford (@uk_baz) <a href="https://twitter.com/uk_baz/status/1021450754958217216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>
    Time for another rethink...<br>
</p>
<h2>Motors and LEGO</h2>
<p>
    Time to break out the <a href="https://www.pololu.com/category/60/micro-metal-gearmotors" target="_blank">
    Micro Metal Gearmotors</a>.
    There are a lot to choose from! With a choice made it was time  for some more testing.
</p>
<p>
    The problem of how to have a quick attach mechanism for the party popper string was still playing on my mind.
</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Testing continues for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RemotePopper?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RemotePopper</a> <a href="https://t.co/ULwyE8AM1S">pic.twitter.com/ULwyE8AM1S</a></p>&mdash; Barry Byford (@uk_baz) <a href="https://twitter.com/uk_baz/status/1022829443050598400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>
    The idea was to attach the motors to some LEGO. The first attempt look good and held the party popper nicely over
    the motor. It was the old problem of how to attach the string that proved to be the weak link.
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yep, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RemotePopper?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RemotePopper</a> isn&#39;t going to work with a crocodile clip on the end <a href="https://t.co/67pPiujaXU">pic.twitter.com/67pPiujaXU</a></p>&mdash; Barry Byford (@uk_baz) <a href="https://twitter.com/uk_baz/status/1022941201064972294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>
    Solving that problem just brought another familiar problem in to play.
    It appears the force to pull a party popper is more than the force to pull LEGO apart...
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And now the motor and party popper are stronger that the LEGO fixing. Time to redesign the fixing... <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RemotePopper?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RemotePopper</a> <a href="https://t.co/eewrdA8ZOr">pic.twitter.com/eewrdA8ZOr</a></p>&mdash; Barry Byford (@uk_baz) <a href="https://twitter.com/uk_baz/status/1023116231539347458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
    Improving the structure of the LEGO around the motor and turning the crocodile clip around brought a step forward
    although results were still not reliable although greatly improve!!!

    Buying a bag of mixed LEGO Technic for eBay allowed for some gearing and attaching the axle at both ends
    which brought big improvements.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
    There are still a number of issues to resolve:
<ul>
    <li>How to attach the string quickly and reliably</li>
    <li>Making the machine compact and robust for easy transportation and storage</li>
    <li>Attaching the electronics to the LEGO</li>
</ul>
