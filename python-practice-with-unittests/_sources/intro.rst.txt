Practice, practice, practice
============================

These exercises have been setup with the idea of allowing people to write
Python code to pass unittests.
All the exercises should have unittests available along with stub code of the
functions that are being tested.
When you first enter the exercise module all the tests will run but fail. The
challenge is to get all the tests to pass.
